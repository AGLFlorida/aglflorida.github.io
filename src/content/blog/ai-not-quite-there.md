## AI still needs oversight.

Just wanted to take a moment to commone on un-managed AI generated content. I honestly don't know where it comes up with some of this stuff but sometimes, it just doesn't make sense

see: https://aglflorida.com/releases/releasenotes-2025Jun27-191928

Where did it get "OpenMainframe" from this git log except?
- docs: add release notes for src/content/releases/releasenotes-2025Jun27-191928.md
- Merge pull request #28 from AGLFlorida/release/next
- feat: add post about summarizer project.
- fix: pages with empty content.
- fix: canonical urls are broken.
- chore: remove empty automation post.
- feat: new blog post re-AI and gitlog.
- fix: using the wrong bot identity.
