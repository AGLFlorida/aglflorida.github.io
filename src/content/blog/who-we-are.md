In a world of accelerating connectivity and rapid AI proliferation, AGL Consulting is grounded in a simple belief: technology should amplify the human experience, not obscure it.

AGL Consulting partners with small and mid-sized businesses that need to modernize their technology without losing sight of their core mission. Many of these organizations lack the time, resources, or focus to prioritize software and IT strategy—AGL steps in to fill that gap with clarity, capability, and a human-first approach.

Founded by seasoned engineering leaders with decades of experience across high-growth platforms like TeamSnap and Boats Group, AGL brings executive-level insight, technical leadership, and operational discipline to companies that can't justify a full-time CTO but still demand world-class technology outcomes.

Whether advising on infrastructure, improving developer workflows, or managing complex migrations, AGL delivers practical, people-centric solutions designed for long-term impact—not short-term hype.

At its core, AGL exists to help businesses do what they do best—by making technology work for people, not the other way around.
