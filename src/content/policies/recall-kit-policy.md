This Privacy Policy explains how AGL Consulting ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our iOS app ("App").

1. No Personal Information Collected

We do not collect or store any personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or location. You can use the App without creating an account or logging in.

2. Advertising

The App displays video ads provided by third-party ad networks such as Google AdMob or similar services. These third parties may collect limited information to serve relevant ads and track ad performance.

This information may include:
- Device type and model
- Operating system version
- IP address (used to estimate general location)
- Advertising Identifier (IDFA)
- App usage data (e.g. how often you use the app)

We do not have access to this data and do not store it on our own servers. The collection and use of this data is governed by the privacy policies of the ad providers.

3. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

This App is not directed to children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.

4. Data Sharing

We do not share any information with third parties except for the advertising services described above.

5. Data Security

Since we do not collect personal data, we do not store any user information on our servers. Ad networks that serve content in the App may store anonymized usage data on their systems.

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will provide notice within the App or on our website.
