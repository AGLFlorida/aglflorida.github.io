AI agents and language models are powerful, but they're only as useful as their ability to interact with your systems, data, and workflows. Building effective agentic integrations—where AI agents can read, write, and act within your technology stack—requires more than just API calls. It requires understanding context, managing state, handling errors, and designing interactions that are reliable, secure, and actually useful.

Let us guide you in building AI enabled workflows that don't just generate text—they understand your business, interact with your systems, and make decisions that drive real value.

## The Promise and Challenge of AGI

AI promises to automate complex workflows, answer questions with context from your systems, and make intelligent decisions. But building agents that actually work in production is harder than it looks:

- **Context management** — Agents need access to relevant information from your systems, databases, and APIs
- **Tool integration** — Agents must be able to call functions, update data, trigger workflows, and interact with your stack
- **Reliability** — Agents need error handling, retries, and fallbacks for when things go wrong
- **Security** — Agents accessing your systems need proper authentication, authorization, and audit trails
- **Cost control** — Uncontrolled agent usage can lead to unexpected API costs
- **Testing** — How do you test and validate agent behavior in complex scenarios?

Most teams start with simple prompts and API calls, then hit walls when they try to build something that actually integrates with their systems and workflows.

## What We Guide You In Building

We offer guidance in building production-ready AI agents that integrate deeply with your technology stack:

<!-- ### Agent Architecture & Framework

We guide you in designing and implementing agent architectures that fit your needs:
- **Single-agent systems** for focused tasks and workflows
- **Multi-agent systems** for complex processes requiring coordination
- **Agent orchestration** for managing agent interactions and workflows
- **State management** for maintaining context across interactions
- **Memory systems** for learning from past interactions -->

### System Integration

We guide you in connecting agents to your existing systems:
- **API integrations** — Recommendations for agents that can call your REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and webhooks
- **Database access** — Guidance on agents that can query and update your databases with proper security
- **Workflow triggers** — Recommendations for agents that can start processes, send notifications, and update systems
- **Third-party services** — Guidance on agents that interact with external services and APIs
- **Legacy system integration** — Recommendations for agents that work with older systems through adapters and wrappers

### Context Management

We guide you in building systems that give agents the right information at the right time:
- **Vector databases** for semantic search across your documents and data
- **Context retrieval** that finds relevant information for agent decisions
- **Knowledge bases** that agents can query and update
- **Real-time data access** for agents that need current system state
- **Context windows** that manage token limits and prioritize information

### Tool Calling & Function Integration

We guide you in implementing tool calling so agents can actually do things:
- **Function definitions** that expose your capabilities to agents
- **Parameter validation** and error handling patterns
- **Tool selection** logic that helps agents choose the right tools
- **Result processing** and feedback loop recommendations
- **Tool chaining** for complex multi-step operations

### Reliability & Error Handling

We guide you in building agents that work reliably in production:
- **Error handling** patterns for API failures, timeouts, and unexpected responses
- **Retry logic** recommendations with exponential backoff and circuit breakers
- **Fallback strategies** when agents can't complete tasks
- **Validation** patterns for agent outputs before taking actions
- **Monitoring** and alerting recommendations for agent behavior and failures

### Security & Compliance

We guide you in ensuring agent integrations are secure and compliant:
- **Authentication** and authorization patterns for agent access to systems
- **Audit logging** recommendations for all agent actions and decisions
- **Data privacy** and PII handling guidance in agent interactions
- **Rate limiting** and cost control recommendations
- **Compliance** guidance with regulations and security policies

## Common Use Cases

While every integration is unique, we frequently build agents for:

**Customer Support Agents**
- Answer questions using your knowledge base and documentation
- Look up customer information and order history
- Create support tickets and escalate issues
- Provide personalized responses based on customer data

**Internal Operations Agents**
- Answer questions about your systems, processes, and data
- Generate reports and summaries from your databases
- Automate routine tasks and workflows
- Provide insights and recommendations based on data analysis

**Content & Documentation Agents**
- Answer questions about your products, services, and processes
- Generate documentation and content from your systems
- Update knowledge bases based on new information
- Help users find information across your documentation

**Workflow Automation Agents**
- Process requests and trigger workflows based on natural language
- Route tasks and decisions to the right people or systems
- Coordinate multi-step processes across systems
- Make decisions based on business rules and data

## Our Approach

We don't guide you in building agents in isolation—we help you integrate them into your existing systems and workflows:

### Assessment & Strategy

We start by understanding:
- Your use cases and goals for agentic integration
- Your existing systems, APIs, and data sources
- Your security and compliance requirements
- Your team's skills and preferences
- Your budget and cost constraints

Based on this, we guide you in designing an agent architecture and integration strategy that fits your context.

<!-- ### Incremental Implementation Guidance

We guide you in building agents incrementally, starting with high-value use cases:
- **Week 1-2**: Architecture design guidance and framework setup recommendations
- **Week 3-4**: Core agent implementation guidance and system integration recommendations
- **Week 5-6**: Context management and tool calling guidance
- **Week 7-8**: Reliability, error handling, and security recommendations
- **Week 9-10**: Testing, validation, and optimization guidance
- **Week 11-12**: Documentation, training, and knowledge transfer

Each phase delivers working functionality, so you start seeing value early. -->

### Production-Ready Patterns

We guide you in building agents using proven patterns:
- **Structured outputs** for reliable data extraction
- **Function calling** for system interactions
- **Retrieval-augmented generation** for context-aware responses
- **Chain-of-thought** for complex reasoning
- **Human-in-the-loop** for critical decisions
- **Observability** for monitoring and debugging

### Team Enablement

We ensure your team can maintain and extend agents:
- Clear documentation of architecture and patterns
- Training on agent frameworks and best practices
- Code examples and templates for common patterns
- Knowledge transfer sessions
- Ongoing guidance during the transition

## Who This Is For

These Integrations works best for organizations that:
- **Have use cases** where AI agents could add value
- **Want to integrate** AI with existing systems and workflows
- **Need production-ready** solutions, not just prototypes
- **Have data and systems** that agents can interact with
- **Want to automate** complex, context-dependent workflows
- **Are ready to invest** in building AI capabilities

If you're not sure if these are right for you, we can help assess your use cases and design a proof-of-concept.

## The AGL Difference

We're not AI consultants who build demos and disappear. We're engineers who understand:
- The realities of building production systems
- The importance of reliability, security, and cost control
- How to integrate AI with existing technology stacks
- The balance between AI capabilities and practical constraints

Our approach is:
- **Practical** — We guide you in building agents that work in real systems with real constraints
- **Production-ready** — We focus on reliability, security, and maintainability
- **Integrated** — We guide you in connecting agents to your existing systems and workflows
- **Measurable** — We track performance, costs, and business impact
