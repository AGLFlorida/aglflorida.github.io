Agile isn't a framework you install—it's a mindset and set of practices that help teams deliver value faster, respond to change, and build better products. But implementing Agile effectively requires more than just running sprints and standups. It requires understanding your team's context, adapting practices to fit your needs, and building sustainable habits.

Our Agile Coaching goes beyond certification and frameworks. We work with your team to guide you in implementing Agile practices that actually work in your environment, delivering measurable improvements in delivery speed, quality, and team satisfaction.

## Why Agile Coaching?

Many teams try to "go Agile" by adopting Scrum or Kanban, only to find that:
- **Sprints feel like mini-waterfalls** — Same problems, just shorter cycles
- **Ceremonies become empty rituals** — Standups, retros, and planning that don't add value
- **Process overhead increases** — More meetings, more documentation, less time building
- **Team frustration grows** — Agile feels like bureaucracy, not empowerment
- **Results don't improve** — Same delivery speed, same quality issues

The problem isn't Agile—it's how it's being implemented. Effective Agile requires:
- Understanding your team's unique context and constraints
- Adapting practices to fit your needs, not forcing a rigid framework
- Building habits and culture, not just processes
- Focusing on outcomes, not just following ceremonies
- Continuous improvement based on what's actually working

That's where Agile Coaching comes in.

## What We Do

Our Agile Coaching is practical, contextual, and results-focused. We don't come in with a one-size-fits-all playbook—we observe, understand, and guide you in building Agile practices that work for your team.

### Assessment & Baseline

We start by understanding where you are:
- Current development process and pain points
- Team structure and dynamics
- Delivery metrics and bottlenecks
- Culture and organizational constraints
- Goals and what success looks like for you

This assessment helps us design an Agile implementation that addresses your specific challenges.

### Customized Framework Implementation

Based on your context, we design and guide you in implementing Agile practices that fit:

**For teams new to Agile:**
- Introduction to Agile principles and values
- Framework selection guidance (Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid)
- Ceremony design and facilitation
- Recommendations for role definition and responsibilities
- Tool selection recommendations and setup guidance

**For teams struggling with Agile:**
- Identifying what's not working and why
- Recommendations for adapting practices to address specific issues
- Guidance on removing process overhead that doesn't add value
- Coaching to re-energize ceremonies with purpose
- Guidance on building habits that stick

**For teams scaling Agile:**
- Recommendations for multi-team coordination and scaling frameworks
- Guidance on cross-team dependencies and communication
- Recommendations for portfolio and program-level planning
- Strategies for maintaining agility at scale
- Guidance on organizational change management

### Sprint Facilitation & Coaching

We don't just tell you how to run sprints—we facilitate them and coach your team:

- Goal setting and focus
- Dependency management

**Daily Standups**

- Product backlog refinement

**Retrospectives**

### Scrum Master Services

For teams that need dedicated Scrum Master support, we provide:

### Metrics & Progress Tracking

We establish metrics to track progress:
- Velocity and delivery predictability
- Cycle time and lead time
- Quality metrics and defect rates
- Team satisfaction and engagement
- Business value delivery

These metrics help us—and you—understand what's working and what needs adjustment.

## Who This Is For

Agile Coaching works best for teams that are:
- **New to Agile** and want to implement it effectively from the start
- **Struggling with Agile** and need help making it work
- **Scaling Agile** across multiple teams or the organization
- **Experiencing delivery issues** and want to improve speed and quality
- **Undergoing transformation** and need guidance through change
- **Looking to improve** and want to take their Agile practice to the next level

## The AGL Approach

We're not Agile consultants who drop in, teach a framework, and leave. We're practitioners who've implemented Agile in real engineering teams. We understand:
- The day-to-day realities of running Agile in engineering organizations
- The balance between process and pragmatism
- How to adapt Agile to fit different contexts and constraints
- The importance of culture and habits, not just ceremonies

Our approach is:
- **Contextual** — We guide you in adapting Agile to fit your team, not the other way around
- **Practical** — We focus on practices that deliver real results
- **Sustainable** — We guide you in building habits and culture that last
- **Measurable** — We track progress and adjust recommendations based on data
- **Human-first** — We recognize that Agile is about people, not processes

## Investment & Timeline

Agile Coaching engagements typically run 3-5 months, with regular coaching sessions, facilitation, and progress tracking. Pricing starts at $10,000 and scales based on:
- Team size and number of teams
- Scope of coaching (framework implementation vs. Scrum Master services)
- Training and certification needs
- Organizational complexity

The investment pays for itself through:
- Faster delivery and shorter cycle times
- Higher quality and fewer defects
- Improved team satisfaction and retention
- Better alignment with business goals
- Sustainable practices that compound over time
