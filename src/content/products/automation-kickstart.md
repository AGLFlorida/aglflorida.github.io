Your team is spending too much time on repetitive tasks that should be automated. Manual deployments, repetitive testing, infrastructure provisioning, and release processes are eating into time that should be spent building features and solving problems.

Automation Kickstart helps you transform your development workflow from manual, error-prone processes into streamlined, reliable automation. We don't just recommend tools—we guide you in building automation that fits your team, your processes, and your goals.

## The Cost of Manual Work

Every manual step in your workflow is:
- **Time you're not building features** — Deployments, testing, and releases that take hours instead of minutes
- **Opportunities for human error** — Manual processes that fail at 2 AM or during critical releases
- **Knowledge silos** — Processes that only one person knows how to run
- **Scaling bottlenecks** — Manual work that doesn't scale as your team grows
- **Developer frustration** — Repetitive tasks that drain energy and motivation

Automation isn't just about speed—it's about reliability, scalability, and freeing your team to focus on what matters.

## What We Automate

Our Automation Kickstart package addresses the highest-impact automation opportunities in your development workflow:

### CI/CD Pipeline

A robust continuous integration and deployment pipeline is the foundation of modern software delivery. We guide you in designing and implementing pipelines that:
- Automatically run tests on every commit
- Build and validate artifacts
- Deploy to staging environments
- Run security scans and code quality checks
- Deploy to production with proper approvals and rollback capabilities

### Testing Automation

Manual testing doesn't scale. We recommend and guide implementation of automated testing frameworks that:
- Run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests automatically
- Provide fast feedback on code changes
- Catch regressions before they reach production
- Generate test reports and coverage metrics
- Integrate seamlessly with your development workflow

### Infrastructure as Code

Manual infrastructure provisioning is slow, error-prone, and hard to reproduce. We guide you in implementing Infrastructure as Code so you can:
- Provision environments consistently and reliably
- Version control your infrastructure
- Spin up new environments in minutes, not days
- Eliminate configuration drift
- Recover from disasters quickly

### Release Automation

Manual releases are stressful and risky. We guide you in automating your release process to:
- Build and version artifacts automatically
- Generate release notes from commit history
- Deploy to multiple environments with proper sequencing
- Run smoke tests and validation checks
- Roll back automatically if issues are detected

### Monitoring & Alerting

Proactive monitoring beats reactive firefighting. We recommend and guide implementation of automation that:
- Monitors application health and performance
- Alerts on anomalies and errors
- Tracks key business and technical metrics
- Provides dashboards for visibility
- Integrates with your team's communication channels

## Our Approach

We don't drop in a generic automation solution and leave. We work with your team to guide you in building automation that fits your context:

### Assessment & Planning

We start by understanding your current workflow:
- What processes are manual and time-consuming?
- Where are the pain points and bottlenecks?
- What tools and infrastructure are you already using?
- What are your team's skills and preferences?
- What are your compliance and security requirements?

Based on this assessment, we create a prioritized roadmap that addresses your highest-impact opportunities first.

### Incremental Implementation Guidance

We guide you in implementing automation incrementally, starting with quick wins that deliver immediate value:
- **Week 1-2**: Guidance on setting up basic CI/CD pipeline
- **Week 3-4**: Recommendations and guidance for automated testing
- **Week 5-6**: Guidance on implementing Infrastructure as Code
- **Week 7-8**: Recommendations for automating releases and deployments
- **Week 9-10**: Guidance on setting up monitoring and alerting

Each phase delivers value independently, so you start seeing benefits early.

### Team Enablement

Automation only works if your team knows how to use it. We:
- Train your team on new tools and processes
- Document everything clearly
- Establish best practices and patterns
- Transfer knowledge so you can maintain and extend automation
- Provide ongoing support during the transition

### Sustainable Practices

We guide you in building automation that's maintainable and extensible:
- Recommendations for clear, documented code and configurations
- Patterns and best practices your team can replicate
- Guidance on integration with your existing tools
- Recommendations for processes that fit your team's workflow
- Ensuring automation makes your team's life easier, not harder

## Who This Is For

Automation Kickstart works best for teams that:
- **Deploy manually** and want to automate releases
- **Test manually** and need automated testing frameworks
- **Provision infrastructure manually** and want Infrastructure as Code
- **Lack CI/CD** and want continuous integration and deployment
- **Have ad-hoc processes** and need standardized automation
- **Are scaling** and need automation to support growth

If you're already automated but want to improve or extend your automation, we can help with that too.

## The AGL Difference

We're not automation consultants who set up tools and disappear. We're engineers who've built and maintained automation at scale. We understand:
- The day-to-day realities of running automation in production
- The balance between automation and flexibility
- How to build automation that developers actually want to use
- The importance of maintainability and documentation

Our guidance helps you build automation that is:
- **Practical** — Designed for real teams with real constraints
- **Maintainable** — Clear, documented, and easy to extend
- **Reliable** — Based on patterns tested and proven in production environments
- **Integrated** — Works with your existing tools and workflows

## Investment & Timeline

Automation Kickstart is a 6-10 week engagement starting at $15,000. Pricing scales based on:
- Complexity of your current workflow
- Number of environments and services
- Scope of automation desired
- Team size and training needs

The investment pays for itself through:
- Time saved on manual processes
- Fewer production incidents from human error
- Faster feature delivery and releases
- Improved developer satisfaction and retention
- Ability to scale without proportional process overhead

## Getting Started

Ready to eliminate manual toil and accelerate delivery? Let's start with a conversation about your current workflow, pain points, and automation goals. We'll assess your needs and guide you in designing an automation plan that delivers immediate value.

Automation isn't about replacing people—it's about amplifying what they can do. Let's guide you in building automation that makes your team more effective.
