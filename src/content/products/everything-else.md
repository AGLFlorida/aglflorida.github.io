Not every problem fits neatly into a predefined package. Sometimes you have a unique challenge, an interesting opportunity, or a problem that requires a custom approach.

That's where we come in.

## Let's Talk

If you have an interesting problem you need help with but it doesn't necessarily fit into one of our standard offerings, reach out. We're happy to have a conversation.

Maybe you need:
- **Custom software development** for a specific project or feature
- **Architecture consulting** for a complex system design challenge
- **Technology selection** and evaluation for a new initiative
- **Legacy system integration** or migration support
- **Security assessment** or compliance work
- **Developer tooling** or internal tool development
- **Something else entirely** that we haven't thought of

We're engineers and problem-solvers. If it's interesting and it involves technology, we're probably up for it.

## How It Works

1. **You reach out** — Tell us about your problem, challenge, or opportunity
2. **We have a conversation** — We'll ask questions, understand your context, and explore solutions
3. **We propose an approach** — If it's a good fit, we'll design a custom engagement
4. **We work together** — We'll solve your problem, build your solution, or help you figure it out

No pressure, no hard sell—just a conversation about whether we can help.

## Pricing

Pricing is variable and depends on:
- Scope and complexity of the work
- Timeline and urgency
- Skills and resources required
- Your budget and constraints

We're transparent about costs and work with you to find an approach that fits your needs and budget.
