Your company needs executive technology leadership, but you're not ready for a full-time CTO. You need someone who can set technical strategy, make architecture decisions, design organizations, and align technology with business goals—without the overhead of a full-time executive hire.

Fractional CTO at AGL provides the strategic technology leadership your company needs. We're the next tier up from team management—we handle technology strategy, architecture, organizational design, and executive leadership while your team focuses on execution.

## Why Fractional CTO?

Many companies find themselves in a gap: they've outgrown ad-hoc technical decisions but aren't ready for a full-time CTO. You might have:
- **No technical strategy** — Technology decisions are reactive, not strategic
- **Architecture debt** — Systems that worked at scale are now limiting growth
- **Organizational confusion** — Unclear team structure, roles, and responsibilities
- **Executive misalignment** — Technology and business goals aren't connected
- **Resource uncertainty** — Unclear how to invest in technology for growth
- **Risk exposure** — Technical decisions made without understanding long-term implications
- **Scaling challenges** — What worked for 5 people doesn't work for 50

A fractional CTO provides executive-level technology leadership on a part-time basis, giving you strategic direction, architectural guidance, and organizational design without the full-time cost.
