Great products come from great teams. But building a high-performing engineering team requires more than technical skills—it requires leadership, process, and people management. Many teams have the talent but lack the management structure to help individuals grow and teams excel.

Team Coaching at AGL is like having an engineering manager in a box. We provide the people management, career development, process coaching, and Agile facilitation that transforms good teams into great ones—without the overhead of a full-time hire.

## Why Team Coaching Matters

Your team has the technical skills. They can write code, ship features, and solve problems. But are they getting the management support they need? Are individuals growing in their careers? Are your processes helping or hindering? Is your culture enabling people to do their best work?

Many engineering teams struggle with:
- **Lack of management support** — No one doing 1-on-1s, career planning, or people management
- **Unclear career paths** — Engineers don't know how to grow or what's expected
- **Process confusion** — Agile ceremonies that don't add value, unclear workflows
- **Communication breakdowns** that lead to duplicated effort and missed requirements
- **Technical debt accumulation** because there's no time or framework for addressing it
- **Knowledge silos** where critical information lives in one person's head
- **Burnout and turnover** from unsustainable practices and unclear expectations

Team Coaching addresses these challenges by providing the management functions your team needs—people management, career development, process coaching, and Agile facilitation—all in one comprehensive package.

## What We Provide

Our coaching approach is practical, measurable, and tailored to your team's specific needs. We don't come in with a one-size-fits-all playbook—we observe, assess, and provide the management support that fits your context.

### Assessment & Baseline

We start by understanding where you are today. Through interviews, observation, and data analysis, we map out:
- Current team dynamics and communication patterns
- Individual career goals and development needs
- Process effectiveness and bottlenecks
- Technical practices and code quality metrics
- Culture and psychological safety indicators
- Leadership effectiveness and growth opportunities

This baseline gives us—and you—clear metrics to measure progress against.

These metrics help us—and you—understand what's working and what needs adjustment.

## Who This Is For

Team Coaching works best for teams that:
- **Lack management support** and need people management functions
- **Have engineers without clear career paths** and need development guidance
- **Are growing rapidly** and need to establish scalable practices
- **Are experiencing friction** in collaboration or delivery
- **Are transitioning** to new methodologies or technologies
- **Are struggling with Agile** and need help making it work
- **Are losing talent** and need to improve culture and retention
- **Need Agile coaching** but also want people management support
- **Preparing for scale** and want to build strong foundations

If your team already has strong management but needs specific help with Agile or processes, we can focus on those areas. If you have processes but lack people management, we can focus there. We adapt to what you need.
