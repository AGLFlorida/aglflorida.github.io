## Overview
This project sets up two open-source LLMs locally Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct and Phi-3 Mini. It uses Ollama to run AI summarization tasks entirely offline.

It includes a NodeJS script that:

- Retrieves commit messages from your Git repo
- Sends them to the selected model
- Returns a press-release-style summary for changelogs, tag messages, etc.

## What It Does
- Uses git describe and git log to get commit messages since the last tag
- Builds a natural-language prompt with that history
- Sends it to Ollamaâ€™s local model endpoint
- Streams and sanitizes the response
- Prints a one-paragraph customer-facing summary
